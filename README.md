                                  USER STORIES

Practique is an app for people who want to hone their skills at their favorite hobbies and to keep track of their progress and the number of hours/minutes that they've been working on a given hobby. They say it takes 10,000 hours to become a master of something, but if you don't keep track, you'll never know for sure if you're a master. Practique is here to help.

Practique will be a web application where users can create an account, select a hobby or hobbies, and log practice sessions. When starting a new hobby the user will be prompted for a weekly goal of hours to practice per week. A stretch goal will be to send an email reminder either daily or every other day that has there remaining hours listed and encourages them to spend some time practicing. 

Through one page there will be two ways to add a session. Either by using the built in stopwatch function, or by adding a session after the fact and just selecting the length of the session and other info. 
Sessions will have a duration, challenge rating(1-5), optional questions: What was difficult? What was easy? What are you goals for you next session? 

Users will have the ability to have multiple hobbies and each hobby will have it's own set of sessions. There will be a main screen where the user will see their sessions listed in a timeline fashion with the most recent sessions on the top and descending to the oldest. There will be a global session tracker at the top which will display the number of sessions during a week/day/month and it will count the total number of hours/minutes for all hobbies combined. 

Encouraging messages will display after every session and when certain numbers of hours are hit there will be congratulatory messages and maybe some sort of badge system. 

When starting a new hobby, the user will be able to add goals for themselves that will be stored at the global level. The user will also be able to add goals before a session which they can check off as they go through the session. If a user does not complete a session goal it will appear at the beginning of their next session to be completed during that next session.
